<h1>Interactive Rating Component</h1>
In this project I created an interactive rating component. The HTML and CSS wasn't overly difficult, although I am still struggling with figuring out transitions. I'm trying to get the "Thank You" card to slide in after hitting "submit".

The Javascript took a bit of time. It took me a while to figure out how to select one of the ratings button and obtain it's value.
